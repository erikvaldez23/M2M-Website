      "I cannot recommend Made 2 Move highly enough! I had seen several doctors and had PT at another facility with no answers and no relief. They were able to properly diagnose my problem and therefore were able to treat me with a combination of physical therapy and dry needling. They truly care for each and every one of their patients. Please go see them. You will not regret it!",

      "Dr. Drea and Dr. Nat are incredibly knowledgeable and proficient in what they do.  I cannot recommend either of them enough, and have referred them to multiple friends and coworkers already!  I went to see them initially for shoulder pain, and the cause was quickly and accurately diagnosed and corrected through the PT plan that they designed.  On top of their expertise, they are both friendly, empathetic people who make it impossible to feel uncomfortable.  I have never felt better, and they can do the same for anyone.  I would urge anyone looking to start physical therapy to go to them over anyone else!",
